## Decription

There are two notebooks for this assignment.  The 'setup' notebook imports the json file and stores the data as a database in MongoDB.  Next, we add a new restraunt entry into the database using PyMongo and make some column type adjustments. 

In the analysis notebook, we are creating a few different views of the data based on the requests from the magazine and storing them into Pandas Dataframes.  

## Installations
